Adaptation of Cmask to the Go programming language

This package is an adaptation of Andre Bartetzki's Cmask software for the Go
programming language. It provides a library that can be imported in any Go
program and a standalone program which uses the library. Both the library and
the program are called gmask. This is not a problem, because Go uses different
places to store packages (GOPATH/pkg) and compiled programs (GOPATH/bin).

Cmask was published under GPL. Thanks to Andre who kindly allowed me to publish
gmask under LGPL:

"Dear Fran√ßois,

thanks for bringing Cmask to a new live!
Yes, you may publish Gmask under LGPL.

best

Andre"

The gmask program reflects exactly Cmask features. It has a parser that recognizes
the grammar written by Andre:

When the program is called on a parameter file respecting Cmask language, it
will output a Csound sco file on standard out. One can also write the attribute
bin="gmask" in a CsScore tag of a csd file to get the score generated on the fly
while playing the csd file with Csound. See the examples directory in the
gmask/gmask directory.

The gmask library can be imported in any go program. The library is more
permissive than the gmask program. For example, in the gmask program some
generators can take args that are a value or a breakpoint function. In the
library, those generators can accept for the same args a value or any generator.
This means that you could for example create a tendency mask with a rnd
generator as low boundarie and an osc-mask-quantizer daisy chain as high
boundarie: in the gmask library, generators have type Generator and modifiers
as well.*/
