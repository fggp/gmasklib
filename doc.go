Adaptation of Cmask to the Go programming language

This package is an adaptation of Andre Bartetzki's Cmask software for the Go
programming language. It provides a library that can be imported in any Go
program. The library is called gmasklib.

Cmask was published under GPL. Thanks to Andre who kindly allowed me to publish
gmask under LGPL:

"Dear Fran√ßois,

thanks for bringing Cmask to a new life!

Yes, you may publish Gmask under LGPL.

best

Andre"

The gmask library can be imported in any go program. The library is more
permissive than the gmask program. For example, in the gmask program some
generators can take args that are a value or a breakpoint function. In the
library, those generators can accept for the same args a value or any generator.
This means that you could for example create a tendency mask with a rnd
generator as low boundarie and an osc-mask-quantizer daisy chain as high
boundarie: in the gmask library, generators have type Generator and modifiers
as well.*/
